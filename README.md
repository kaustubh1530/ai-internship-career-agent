# 🚀 AI Career Intelligence System

A startup-style AI career platform that analyzes resumes, refreshes live job listings, ranks jobs using semantic AI matching, and provides personalized career recommendations through a multi-agent AI system.

This project is built as a flagship AI + backend engineering portfolio project using Python, Streamlit, OpenAI, LangChain, embeddings, live job APIs, and multi-agent orchestration.

---

## Project Overview

The **AI Career Intelligence System** helps users:

- Upload a resume PDF
- Extract skills from the resume
- Refresh live job listings from a job API
- Rank jobs using semantic similarity and skill matching
- View explainable job matches with match scores
- Get AI-powered career advice
- Understand skill gaps and next steps

This is not just a chatbot.  
It is a full AI system with agents, memory, decision logic, semantic matching, and a product-style Streamlit interface.

## Key Features

### Resume Intelligence

- Upload resume as PDF
- Extract resume text
- Identify skills from the resume
- Use resume content for AI job matching and career advice

### Live Job Refresh

- Fetch fresh job listings using Adzuna API
- Save live jobs into a structured local data layer
- Automatically rebuild job embeddings after refreshing jobs
- Use updated job data during analysis

### Multi-Agent AI System

The system uses multiple agents with shared state and communication:

- **Resume Agent**  
  Extracts skills and profile strengths from the resume.

- **Job Agent**  
  Loads jobs, performs semantic matching, scores jobs, removes duplicates, and selects top matches.

- **Advisor Agent**  
  Generates personalized career recommendations based on resume, skills, and job matches.

- **Strategy Agent**  
  Provides fallback career strategy when job matches are weak.

- **Decision Agent**  
  Evaluates output quality and supports intelligent retry decisions.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents communicate using a shared message system.

Example:

ResumeAgent → JobAgent: User skills extracted
JobAgent → AdvisorAgent: Top semantic job matches ready 

### Semantic Job Matching

The app uses OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity to compare resume meaning with job descriptions.

Instead of only checking exact words, the system understands semantic similarity.

Example:

Resume: backend APIs, Python, FastAPI
Job: build scalable web services
